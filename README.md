# DHT11-Monitor-with-Java-WebSocket
This project enables communication between an Arduino with a DHT11 sensor and a Java server. The Arduino reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and sends it to the Java server over serial communication. The Java server, in turn, relays this data to connected clients.
# Key Features
1. Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity.
2. Arduino sensor data transmission to a Java server.
3. Multi-client support for accessing environmental data.
# Execution
1. Arduino Setup: In Arduino Sketch, upload and run the provided file.
2. Java Server Setup: After Arduino Setup, run the server and connect all the clients.
