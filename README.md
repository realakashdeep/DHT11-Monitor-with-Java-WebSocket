# DHT11-Monitor-with-Java-WebSocket
This project enables communication between an Arduino with a DHT11 sensor and a Java server. The Arduino reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and sends it to the Java server over serial communication. The Java server, in turn, relays this data to connected clients.
